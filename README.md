# Music-Recommender-Engine
Music Rec Engine

The data set is a 600K song dataset from Spotify Web API. It's features include the song name, published date, and song attributes such as speechiness, instrumentalness, loudness, mode, key, tempo, danceability, acousticness etc. This recommendation engine uses these features to find a cosine similarity between songs and retrieves the top 5 in a sorted list. 

So far I have only able to get the index of the song and not the song name on the entry.
